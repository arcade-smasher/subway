# Subway

**Subway is just a Tunnel reskin.** We might replace Tunnel with Subway someday.

---
This is Subway, a web tool for avoiding internet censorship. Subway has various links for proxies, links to privacy-focused alternatives to YouTube, and a command line, for more technical users. Subway can be used for getting around your internet restrictions, or unblocking websites at school.

No, you can not contribute to Subway, but you can suggest features to add/remove, report bugs or report unblocked links you may know.
***
If you just want an unblocker for school, download the `tunnel.html`.
